## Tractatus Logico Orgnosticismus

1. The value of traditional intangibles is outpacing the value of tangible assets at a significant and increasing rate. Organizational capital presents a substantial portion of those intangibles.

    + Allegedly, Drucker said that it’s impossible to manage what you can’t measure; while we disagree with the extremity of such a statement, we still believe that managing what you don’t measure is pretty damn hard. The ability to set a meaningful baseline and track progress is at the core of every productivity optimization.
    
        + To compete in industry 4.0, leaders and investors need to start measuring and managing their organizational capital with the same rigor as financial results. 


2. Knowledge has always been the biggest agent of change. 

    + Knowledge is often hidden in large, unstructured data that is hard to capture and understand.
    
        + Organizational knowledge is distributed and hidden within the teams and individuals. It is ultimately the answer to “who are we?” and “what can we do?” and, consequently, “what is the X that we need to change to achieve Y?”. 
            
            + Capturing scattered and hidden organizational data and transforming it into knowledge is at the foundation of understanding and change within the leadership and, consequently, the organization as a whole. 
            
3. HR teams, by and large, lack the resources and influence on a management/board level to drive the change in the way people data can shape business strategies. We believe that the mass implementation of data-informed decision making to develop org strategies will become a reality once we witness a strong top-down push.

    + Infrastructure complexity and cost, and trust in HR data quality, prevent HR and management teams from prioritizing the adoption of people analytics solutions at times of fast growth and expansion. Ironically, the hypergrowth phase is the part of the company lifecycle when people and organizational decisions make a difference between life and death. 
    
        + By simplifying the data ingestion infrastructure, reducing the cost to start, and introducing a proper metric data health assessment and prioritization matrix, we can significantly reduce the barrier to entry for people analytics. 
        
    + Education is the second most significant barrier to the mass adoption of analytics in HR.
    
        + People analytics is still a young field compared to financial analytics and reporting. The level of maturity of people analytics adoption across HR teams can be likened to the 'teenage sex' story: "Everyone talks about it, but nobody really knows how to do it. And because everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, everyone claims they are doing it."
        
        + Providing educational materials and opportunities and empowering the community to learn from the success stories will increase data literacy and speed up the adoption of people analytics in HR. 

4. Products for HR data analytics generally focus on building companies’ capability to either generate new data or aggregate existing sets.

    + Products that allow you to create new data (such as survey tools) are generally siloed and provide information and recommendations disconnected from the context of the organization and business directions. This makes it hard for business-oriented managers to find the real value in the set of “engagement” metrics other than relying on the common knowledge that engagement drives performance. 
    
        + Out of hundreds of engagement, effectiveness, and culture surveys, less than 10% pass the test-retest reliability, and 10% of those show convergent and discriminant validity for the constructs they claim to measure. 
        
        + Sending endless employee surveys is creating fatigue and resentment. However, surveying is still one of the most prominent methods to assess human experience. Companies need to challenge their survey strategies and make them lean by removing unnecessary probes.
        
    + Pure HR data aggregation makes it hard for anyone who lacks the I-O psychology reference system and theoretical knowledge to interpret the data in the right and, ultimately, meaningful way.
    
        + HR data aggregation products often limit themselves to HR datasets, neglecting business data, and market research.
    
    + The future success of producing value from surveys involves combining survey data with HR and finance systems data. 

        + Without such systems, managers will continue to be oblivious to the questions related to the quality of hire, drivers or pay fairness perceptions, causes of turnover and burnout, and others. 
    
5. Theory without data is empty; data without theory is blind.

    + While conducting a proper human capital diagnostic process, companies need to precisely determine what kind of data they require before the collection starts. Only if you have a theory in mind, you’ll know what type of data you need to track.
    
        + An abundant supply of data in the world is creating a systemic data fetishism. Avoid collecting data for the vanity’s sake or for the sake of filling the dashboard forms. Narrow the focus and sift through the information that is essential for business leaders to make informed decisions.
        
        + We don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Existing diagnostic paradigms and theories can leverage years of research and benchmarking data to grasp how behavioral components of any organization can be explained and predicted.
        
        + One of the most valuable efforts in the process of building the future diagnostic tools is meta-research and access to meta-data that integrates existing I-O psychology paradigms into compatible diligence and governance framework. 
        
6. Complex social systems, such as teams and organizations, express dynamic properties that cannot be explained by simplistic cause and effect relationships. Instead of looking for causes behind interaction outcomes, we need to identify a minimum number of conditions that increase the statistical likelihood of desired results.

7. Full organizational diagnostics should cover the three base layers of assessment - organizational/culture level, team design level, and leadership level.

    + Cultures inevitably form, and they are too valuable to be governed by chance.
    
        + Cultures are the vehicle of both good and bad organizational habits.
        
    + Teams have the capability to generate results that greatly surpass the capacities of an individual. Still, studies show that should never be taken as a given.
    
        + Mission-critical teams are the key generators of business effectiveness.
        
    + Peter’s principle explains that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to the level of incompetence. 
    
        + The principle is more often than not observed among leadership roles in high-growth environments. Technically skilled individuals are promoted quickly to managerial roles. 
        
            + Organizations promote technical experts to managerial roles because leadership skills are low in supply.
            
            + Growing companies rarely invest in creating leadership development climate early on in their lifecycle. 
            
        + Managers are the key drivers of organizational change.
        
8. While tracking HR metrics, one should always have two components in mind: a business goal, and employees’ health/well-being. 

    + Businesses are not families—if we are to use metaphors, they should be compared to sports teams. As such, they always have a tangible goal to achieve.
    
    + The ends do not justify the means. Achieving team goals should not endanger members’ health and well-being.
    
9. Every employee should be the owner of their personal data. Organizational diagnostics need not be done on an individual, employee, level. The lowest assessment layer should keep individuals in mind, but focus on team dynamics and improving conditions on a team and culture level.
